Riot helmet looks dumb like this
Pilot helmet looks okay but opportunity for crazy shit

Get rid of rock shirt
Sport T-shirt doesn't let you manually change
Military t-shirt has no choices, decals, anything
green camo tee doesn't let you choose
urban camo tee could probably use a better texture for colors


Pants
Make denim pants the rainbow one
Player doesn't need "military pants" they're just pants


Next Step:
Change the lua so that you can cycle between baseTextures in the same way that you can cycle through textureChoices
Add color palette picker
