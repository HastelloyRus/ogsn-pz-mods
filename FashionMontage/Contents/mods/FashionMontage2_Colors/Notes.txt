Riot helmet looks dumb like this (make diff options instead)
Pilot helmet looks okay but opportunity for crazy shit



Workman shirt should not be in player list
Denim shirt should be rainbow
Lumberjack shirt should be rainbow
medical scrub shirt rainbow
Undo jockey shirt changes entirely - will need to assign the new jackets different xml
restore camo shirt choices - may need to assign the colorful version a new xml (or just make the urban version colorful)


Tshirt
Undo changes to pro baseball shirts (it should be three items again)
If 'sport' tees were separate items, restore those too
restore camo shirt choices - may need to assign the colorful version a new xml (or just make the urban version colorful)
give profession shirts a decal (or choice thereof), a white base, and color selectable
medical scrub tee needs colors


Pants
Make denim jeans rainbow
Player doesn't need "military pants" they're just pants
doesn't need navy pants
suit pants - make rainbow (should be fine now)
med scrubs are currently the prof one, not rainbow


Next Step:
Change the lua so that you can cycle between baseTextures in the same way that you can cycle through textureChoices
Add color palette picker
