description=[b][u]Q: What is the area across the river?[/u][/b]
description=
description=A: That is a non-vanilla, but popular and semi-canonical map called [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=926737806]Over the River[/url]. The in-map game items have the bridge crossed out in red sharpie. I might at some point make different versions of the map that load differently depending on which optional maps you have enabled.

description=[b][u]Q: You misspelled 'County"[/u][/b]
description=
description=A: It's actually called Knox Country in the game! I thought it was County, too, until the good folks on the Discord channel corrected me. There is a real life Knox County in Kentucky but it's in a  totally different part of the state.

description=The game area most closely aligns with the real life counties of Meade, Hardin, Bullitt, and Breckenridge.
